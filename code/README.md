`BestStage0Model.ipynb`([jupyter view](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/andyharless/paces/blob/master/code/BestStage0Model.ipynb)): train and validate the best model  
`ModelExperiments.ipynb`([jupyter view](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/andyharless/paces/blob/master/code/ModelExperiments.ipynb)): messy code to try versions of the model ("how the sausage is made")  
`SaveMegabatch.ipynb`([jupyter view](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/andyharless/paces/blob/master/code/SaveMegabatch.ipynb)): standardize clips for use as training/validation data and produce large files  
`SongsSliceDiceSetsWork2.ipynb` ([jupyter view](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/andyharless/paces/blob/master/code/SongsSliceDiceSetsWork2.ipynb)): process each song into spectrogram and candidate tempos  
`eda.ipynb` ([jupyter view](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/andyharless/paces/blob/master/code/eda.ipynb)): examine training data with an eye to preprocessing and visualization  
`get_training_data.py`: sample clips from songs and associate each clip with a candidate tempo  
`inferential.ipynb`([jupyter view](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/andyharless/paces/blob/master/code/inferential.ipynb)): some hypothesis tests  
`pace_params.py`: parameters used by other files
